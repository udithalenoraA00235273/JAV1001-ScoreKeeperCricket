**!!!! Project Title - Score Keeping app for cricket !!!!**

This app layout is made for keeping the socres in a cricket match. It displays the team total, wickets & extra runs. The first batting team is named as Team One and the innings will be over when they have lost all the 10 wickets. For each socring options there are specific buttons for each team. For extra runs have an option to select weather it's wide ball or no ball. And if the wide count is 5 user can select the number 5 button under the extras option and if the wide count is in the range of 1-4 user can select the plus button as per the scenario. For the purpose of this assignment i have created the wicket button as a negative value, which means when a wicket fallen down 5 runs will be deducted from the team total. After first team got all out user gets a message how much runs needed to win for the second team. If second team got out before the first team score user gets a message as Team one won the match  and if the second team gets pass the score set by first team user will get a message as Team Two won. 
After the match ended user can select the reset button down below to reset the scoreboard and start a new match.
Enjoy.....
